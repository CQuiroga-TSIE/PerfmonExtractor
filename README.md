# PerfmonExtractor
This is a small PowerShell script which extracts the counters data from Performance Monitor files (.BLG) and saves it in a CSV

# Why was this created?
I had to extract only a few counters' values from hundreds of Performance Monitor files (.blg) and do the aggregation in a spreadsheet

# Usage
<code>PS:> ReadPerfmon.ps1</code>
<br>Enter the Server Name to which the performance monitors belong
<br>Enter the folder where the .blg files are located
